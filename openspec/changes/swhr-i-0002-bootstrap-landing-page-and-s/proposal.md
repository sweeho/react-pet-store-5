# Bootstrap, landing page and shared site shell

## Why

Every capability in "React Pet Store 5 Migration" needs one place to start from and one frame to sit in. Without a shared shell each capability invents its own navigation, header and layout, and nothing owns the landing page.

## What Changes

- Stand up the application boilerplate this initiative builds on, or extend the one that exists.
- Add the landing page every user arrives at.
- Add the shared site shell: global navigation, header, footer and page layout that every capability's screens render inside.
- Add the shared empty, error and loading frames every page reuses.

## Impact

- Every other capability in this initiative depends on this one and is released after it ships.
- The global navigation carries one entry per primary area:

- Localization (`localization`)
- Sign-on and access control (`sign-on`)
- Catalog browsing and search (`catalog-browsing`)
- Customer account and profile (`customer-account`)
- Shopping cart (`shopping-cart`)
- Checkout and order placement (`checkout`)
- Order approval (`order-approval`)
- Supplier inventory (`supplier-inventory`)
- Customer notifications (`customer-notifications`)
